    <!--Implementasi-->
    <h1>IMPLEMENTATION</h1>

    <p>Today i've learn about any tag on html including how we can make a paragraph on html and here i using <b> "p" </b> tag on my creating a paragraph like this. I think this is a more important tag on html because all of paragraph more better if making with this tag.</p>
    
    <p>Beside learn about paragraph tag and understanding how to use, I also learn about how to add more space between paragraph with <b> "br" </b> tag and don't worry guys I'll show you what the "br" tag with example bellow !</p>

    <br>

    <p>if you guys relize the space this paragraph with before is have more spaces than paragraph two to paragraph one, thats cool right!.</p>

    <p>Don't forget here I have a interest tag that will show to your guys. The tag is about making horizontal line on our website and that is "hr" tag !. and, yepp maybe you guys was relize at the top of this web have a horizontal line and that is making by <b> "hr" </b> tag!</p>

    <p>And last but not least I wanna show some can make our writing more uniqe with "<b>bold</b>", "<i>italic</i>", and "<u>underline</u>" using <b>"b", "i", and "u" </b> tag.</p>

    <br>

    <p>Okay, so thats all what I learn today thats so fun and see you next practices guys!.</p>
